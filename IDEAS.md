1. Generate Reports by Event Type and Date
   Relevant code:

   - `src/main/java/br/edu/ifba/inf0008/uniEvents/services/ReportsManager.java` (has a generateReport method that builds a report string for a list of events, but no code found for filtering by event type or date)
   - No UI/menu code found that lets the user select type/date for reports.

   Missing:

   - No filtering or report generation by event type or date in the UI or service layer.
